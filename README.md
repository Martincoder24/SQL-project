# SQL-project


## Description:

This is a Bookstore database made in SQL. I have added different tables such as regular tables and junction tables and inserted some data in these tables.

## What I learned:

This was a project that taught me how table creation is working. How to insert data and how to connect tables with each other. I learned how to use stored procedure and how to create more advanced search queries to receive more valuable information that can be obtained through databases.
